# Real-time EEG feedback on alpha power lateralization leads to behavioral improvements in a covert attention task

**Dataset**: `openneuro_ds002034` | **Year**: 2022 | **URL**: https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds002034
**Category**: Action/Output | **Subjects**: 14 | **Files (Completed)**: 167 | **Channels**: 82.0 | **Sampling Rate**: 512.0 Hz

## Paradigm

Participants performed a covert spatial attention task where they were trained to lateralize their alpha-band EEG power using real-time neurofeedback. The study evaluated whether closed-loop neurofeedback of alpha lateralization improves behavioral performance in a spatial attention paradigm. No trial-level event markers are stored in the BIDS EEG files; the task condition is reflected continuously in the EEG signal itself.

## Kernel Responsibilities

- **Type 1 (Raw-meta extraction only)**: Extract and normalize raw labels from events/trigger streams.
- **Type 2 (Raw + Super meta integration)**: Derive and merge high-level labels that are not directly represented in raw events.
- **Type 3 (Label-route orchestration)**: Route final labels to EEGUnity-compatible channels (`Annotation`, `stim`, `misc`) with reproducible schema.

> **Selected Mode**: Type 1 + Type 3
> **Why**: Raw markers are sufficient for primary tasks.
> **Primary Label Routes**: Annotation

## Event Structure

| Event ID | Count (total) | Type | Meta Level | Meaning |
|----------|---------------|------|------------|---------|
| *(none)* | - | - | raw | No event markers detected in EEG files; continuous neurofeedback paradigm |

> **Event Type**: short=stimulus onset <2s; long=sustained state >=2s; rest=resting marker; admin=exclude
> - `long`: sustained-state marker (>=2 s), for `epoch_by_long_event_hdf5`
> - `rest`: resting-state segment marker, for `epoch_by_segmentation_hdf5`
> - `admin`: system/boundary marker, **exclude** from epoch target_events

### Normal Task 1: Resting / Continuous Segmentation (resting)
- **Task Type**: regression
- **Epoch Method**: `epoch_by_segmentation_hdf5`
- **Epoch Parameters**: segment_length = 2.0 s, overlap = 0.5
- **Label Route**: `Annotation`
- **Target Definition**: N/A (null (no trial-level labels available))
- **Notes**: Continuous neurofeedback paradigm; alpha lateralization index may be computed from raw EEG as a continuous target if desired.
## Data Quality Notes

- No trial-level event markers detected in any EEG files; only continuous recordings available.
- Real-time neurofeedback paradigm - EEG signal itself contains the task-relevant information.
- Verify channel count consistency across subjects before pooling.
